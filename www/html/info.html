        <p class="exp">I was playing with Python to gain some experience when I suddenly got an idea. <br>
          Using the hex() built in function, you can get an hexadecimal for every number. So using the, also built in
          function, ord() I get the number for every letter in a string. Then I pass it through the hex to obtain the hexadecimal value
          of said string. <br>
          To keep it short, colors are coded using 6 hexadecimal digits. So traslating letters into hexadecimal digits it's an easy task
          but then you realize that every letter is equal to 2 hexadecimal digits, that means only the three initial letters of a world
          is equal to a full color. To get my way around it, I developed an algorithm that uses every character in a string to make a color.
          By adding the following letters' values to the initial three and keeping it in a 6 digit range. <br><br>
          TL;DR: I made an algorithm that takes a world and turns it into a color by doing math. <br><br>
